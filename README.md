# Text-Summarizer-Project
Text Summarizer Project
Overview
This project is a text summarizer built using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It leverages the PEGASUS model, specifically fine-tuned on the SamSum dataset, to generate concise and coherent summaries of given text inputs. The primary goal is to provide an efficient tool for summarizing dialogues and other conversational texts.

Features
Model: Utilizes the PEGASUS model from Hugging Face, known for its state-of-the-art performance in abstractive text summarization.
Dataset: Trained on the SamSum dataset, which contains thousands of annotated chat dialogues, making it well-suited for summarizing conversational text.
Acknowledgments
Hugging Face for providing the robust and easy-to-use Transformers library.
The authors of the PEGASUS model and the SamSum dataset for their contributions to the field of natural language processing.
